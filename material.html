                 Tracing back to its origins, rock color has a long history in Chinese art history and even appeared earlier than ink painting. 
                 In addition to some cave paintings in ancient times, the use of rock color in painting religious stories and architectural decorations can be traced back to the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Sui and Tang Dynasties. 
                 Before ink painting became popular, rock color painting was the mainstream of Chinese painting and directly influenced today's Japanese painting.

          <h3>Painting Made of Gravels</h3>
          <p> It is different from glossy oil paints, and from watercolors and acrylic paints that can be diluted with water. It feels heavy in the hand and appears gray in the painting. Some are rock colors made directly from natural rocks, and some are artificial rock colors made from feldspar, quartz and other minerals.</p>
          <p>Each ore has different size, brightness, thickness, texture, etc. Use flat pens, brushes, and scrapers to apply, and finally create a colorful and crystal beauty that is completely different from other materials and types of painting such as ink, oil painting, and watercolor.</p>
          <p>Painting with mineral rock powder was once a Chinese cultural tradition and the mainstream of Chinese painting, and it reached its splendid heyday. Unfortunately, after the Tang Dynasty, this style of painting gradually declined and the techniques were gradually lost. Instead, scroll paintings were made on paper and silk. There is a large blank area in the picture, and the skin base is no longer produced, pursuing a light, delicate and elegant mood. What can be inspected now are represented by many murals in Kizil, Dunhuang, Maijishan, Xi'an, Tibet and other places.</p>
          <p>Japanese painting originated in the matrix of Chinese culture and grew along the lines of Tang-e, Yamato-e, and Ukiyo-e. It then underwent changes in the 1950s, making the materials used for painting have different properties from production to use. In addition to mutating and expanding China's classical mineral colors, he also created a synthetic material - new rock, which enabled Japanese paintings to step out of the classical aesthetic stereotypes and language system and enter the modern category.</p>
